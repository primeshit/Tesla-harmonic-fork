## Overview

The Tesla Harmonic Fork (THF) is a recursive integer sequence that grows rapidly and exhibits surprisingly structured behavior — including the natural emergence of prime substrings, palindromes, harmonic rhythm, and self-echoing digit zones.

It combines:
- Recursive concatenation
- Tesla-inspired digit logic (3, 6, 9)
- Prime-indexed mutation spikes
